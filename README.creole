= a GNU doc viewer =

This is an example GNU doc viewer as a //single page// javascript app.

That means it's a webapp, you use a modern HTML5 browser to view
it. The context changes you see while using it are not browser page
changes, they are DOM manipulations achieved through AJAX events.

The app is designed to show how a complex info reader could be made
with very little control over the HTML.

The HTML here is pulled from the GNU website. It's only the emacs
manual but that's just to simplify things slightly. Mostly it would
not be difficult to make an info reader for all GNU documents. It
would just require a bit of code mapping them together.

=== Can I see it? ===

Sure!

=== the role of elnode ===

Elnode is here because it's easy to make do lots of different
things. In this app it's proxying the GNU website to send Emacs info
manual nodes to our JS and it's browserifying the JavaScript
(browserify is a particular way of combining JavaScript files
together).

Elnode could easily be replaced by other technologies here. I'm using
it because it's easy for me.


=== how to ===

Dependencies:

* emacs 24.3
* elnode for emacs 0.9.9.8.1
* nodejs and npm

Install:-

* clone the repo
* npm install .
* start the elnode app in an Emacs
** use latest elnode 0.9.9.8.1
* hit http://localhost:elnode-port
** whatever you set the port to when you started elnode for the app


I'll make a Docker for this and run it on a host somewhere.
